<p> Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The maximum allowed timeout value you can set the value to is 12 hours. This means you can't extend the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more than a total visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more information visibility timeout, see <a href= "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html" > Visibility Timeout </a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i> .) </p> <p> For example, let's say you have a message and its default message visibility timeout is 30 minutes. You could call <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with a value of two hours and the effective timeout would be two hours and 30 minutes. When that time comes near you could again extend the time out by calling ChangeMessageVisiblity, but this time the maximum allowed timeout would be 9 hours and 30 minutes. </p> <p> <b>NOTE:</b> There is a 120,000 limit for the number of inflight messages per queue. Messages are inflight after they have been received from the queue by a consuming component, but have not yet been deleted from the queue. If you reach the 120,000 limit, you will receive an OverLimit error message from Amazon SQS. To help avoid reaching the limit, you should delete the messages from the queue after they have been processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process the messages. </p> <p> <b>IMPORTANT:</b>If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to an amount more than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum time remaining. </p> <p> <b>IMPORTANT:</b>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message the next time it is received reverts to the original timeout value, not the value you set with the ChangeMessageVisibility action. </p>
