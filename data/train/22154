Reset the stream.  If the stream has been marked, then attempt to reposition it at the mark.  If the stream has not been marked, then attempt to reset it in some way appropriate to the particular stream, for example by repositioning it to its starting point.  Not all character-input streams support the reset() operation, and some support reset() without supporting mark().
