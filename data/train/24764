<p> After the test case is executed, if any SUT thread is still running, we will wait for their termination. To identify which thread belong to SUT, before test case execution we should check which are the threads that are running. </p> <p> WARNING: The sandbox might prevent accessing thread informations, so best to call this method from outside this class </p>
