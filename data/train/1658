Deletes the current row from this <code>JoinRowSetImpl</code> object and notifies listeners registered with this rowset that a row has changed. This method cannot be called when the cursor is on the insert row. <P> This method marks the current row as deleted, but it does not delete the row from the underlying data source.  The method <code>acceptChanges</code> must be called to delete the row in the data source.
