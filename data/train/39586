May be called by the Evaluator prior to a series of individuals to  evaluate, and then ended with a finishEvaluating(...).  If this is the case then the Problem is free to delay modifying the individuals or their fitnesses until at finishEvaluating(...).  If no prepareToEvaluate(...) is called prior to evaluation, the Problem must complete its modification of the individuals and their fitnesses as they are evaluated as stipulated in the relevant evaluate(...) documentation for SimpleProblemForm  or GroupedProblemForm.  The default method does nothing.  Note that prepareToEvaluate() can be called *multiple times* prior to finishEvaluating() being called -- in this case, the subsequent calls may be ignored.
