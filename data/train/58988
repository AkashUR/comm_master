A blocking wait for this ThreadPool to be in idle state, which means that there are no more tasks in the Queue or currently executed by one of the threads. BE AWARE that this method may get out from blocking state when a task is currently sent to the ThreadPool not from this thread context. Thus it is not safe to call this method in case there are several threads feeding the TreadPool with tasks (calling execute). The safe way to call this method is from the thread that is calling execute and when there is only one such thread. Note that this method differs from awaitTermination, as it can be called without shutting down the ThreadPoolExecuter.
