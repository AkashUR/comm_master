Executed when UPCL is set to 1. Cfr http://edevice.fujitsu.com/fj/MANUAL/MANUALp/en-pdf/CM71-10147-2E.pdf This bit is used to initialize the internal state of the CSIO. Setting the bit to "1": - The CSIO will be reset directly (software reset). The register setting, however, will be retained. In this case, communication of the data which is being transmitted or received will be cut off immediately. - The baud rate generator will reload the value set in BGR1/BGR0 registers, and then restart the operation. - All the transmission/reception interrupt sources (TDRE, TBI, RDRF and ORE) will be initialized ("1100B").
