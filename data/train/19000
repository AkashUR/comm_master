Invoked by the host on node group change. ServiceMaintenanceRequest object is set in the operation body, with the reasons field indicating the maintenance reason. An implementation of this method that needs to interact with the state of this service must do so as if it were a client of this service. That is: the state of the service should be retrieved by requesting a GET; and the state of the service should be mutated by submitting a PATCH, PUT or DELETE.
