Writes a class file as <code>writeFile()</code> does although this method does not prune or freeze the class after writing the class file.  Note that, once <code>writeFile()</code> or <code>toBytecode()</code> is called, it cannot be called again since the class is pruned and frozen. This method would be useful for debugging.
