Increase the contrast of the bitmap font for rendering on top of a surface whose color is darker. This is useful when drawing anti-aliased bitmap fonts using a light color (e.g. white) on top of a dark surface (e.g. black), the font often breaks down if its contrast is not increased due to the way alpha blending appears to the eye. <p>Notice that this method only works in one way, contrast cannot be decreased properly in a font and it should be cleared and reloaed with a Look and Feel switch.
