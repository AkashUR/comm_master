Detaches the iterator from the set which it iterated over, releasing any computational resources and placing the iterator in the INVALID state. After<code>detach</code> has been invoked, calls to <code>nextNode</code> or<code>previousNode</code> will raise the exception INVALID_STATE_ERR. <p> This operation is a no-op in NodeSetDTM, and will not cause  INVALID_STATE_ERR to be raised by later operations. </p>
