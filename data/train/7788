This method is called on a MasterProblem by the Slave.  You should use this method to store away received data via the dataIn stream for later transferring to the current EvolutionState via the transferAdditionalData method.  You should NOT expect this MasterProblem to be used for by the Slave for evolution (though it might).  By default this method does nothing, which is the usual situation.  The EvolutionState is provided solely for you to be able to output warnings and errors: do not rely on it for any other purpose (including access of the random number generator or storing any data).
