<p> Deletes the queue specified by the <b>queue URL</b> , regardless of whether the queue is empty. If the specified queue does not exist, Amazon SQS returns a successful response. </p> <p> <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Use DeleteQueue with care; once you delete your queue, any messages in the queue are no longer available. </p> <p> When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example, a SendMessage request might succeed, but after the 60 seconds, the queue and that message you sent no longer exist. Also, when you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name. </p> <p> We reserve the right to delete queues that have had no activity for more than 30 days. For more information, see <a href= "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/SQSConcepts.html" > How Amazon SQS Queues Work </a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i> . </p>
