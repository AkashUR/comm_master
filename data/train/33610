In some cases, it is desirable to immediately release a ResultSet database and JDBC resources instead of waiting for this to happen when it is automatically closed. The close method provides this immediate release. <p> <B>Note:</B> A ResultSet is automatically closed by the Statement the Statement that generated it when that Statement is closed, re-executed, or is used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results. A ResultSet is also automatically closed when it is garbage collected. </p>
