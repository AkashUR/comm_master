Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it should stop its execution. It is called when the Web page that contains this applet has been replaced by another page, and also just before the applet is to be destroyed. <p> A subclass of <code>Applet</code> should override this method if it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web page containing it is no longer visible. For example, an applet with animation might want to use the <code>start</code> method to resume animation, and the <code>stop</code> method to suspend the animation. <p> The implementation of this method provided by the <code>Applet</code> class does nothing.
