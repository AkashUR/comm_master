Given a set of encoded rules in startDay and startDayOfMonth, decode them and set the startMode appropriately.  Do the same for endDay and endDayOfMonth.  Upon entry, the day of week variables may be zero or negative, in order to indicate special modes.  The day of month variables may also be negative.  Upon exit, the mode variables will be set, and the day of week and day of month variables will be positive. This method also recognizes a startDay or endDay of zero as indicating no DST.
