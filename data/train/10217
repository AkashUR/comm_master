main() method for running this class from the command line. <p/> <B>The options shown here are not yet finalized and will be changing over the next several releases.</B> <p/> The simplest way to turn and applet into an application is to add the following code to your program: <PRE>static public void main(String args[]) { PApplet.main(new String[] { "YourSketchName" }); }</PRE> This will properly launch your applet from a double-clickable .jar or from the command line. <PRE> Parameters useful for launching or also used by the PDE: <p/> --location=x,y        upper-lefthand corner of where the applet should appear on screen. if not used, the default is to center on the main screen. <p/> --present             put the applet into full screen presentation mode. requires java 1.4 or later. <p/> --exclusive           use full screen exclusive mode when presenting. disables new windows or interaction with other monitors, this is like a "game" mode. <p/> --hide-stop           use to hide the stop button in situations where you don't want to allow users to exit. also see the FAQ on information for capturing the ESC key when running in presentation mode. <p/> --stop-color=#xxxxxx  color of the 'stop' text used to quit an sketch when it's in present mode. <p/> --bgcolor=#xxxxxx     background color of the window. <p/> --sketch-path         location of where to save files from functions like saveStrings() or saveFrame(). defaults to the folder that the java application was launched from, which means if this isn't set by the pde, everything goes into the same folder as processing.exe. <p/> --display=n           set what display should be used by this applet. displays are numbered starting from 1. <p/> Parameters used by Processing when running via the PDE <p/> --external            set when the applet is being used by the PDE <p/> --editor-location=x,y position of the upper-lefthand corner of the editor window, for placement of applet window </PRE>
