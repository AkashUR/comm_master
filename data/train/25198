Resets this <code>Polygon</code> object to an empty polygon. The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex data at the beginning. All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices are discarded. Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset are reused, creating a new empty <code>Polygon</code> might be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if the number of vertices in the new polygon data is significantly smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the reset.
