Flushes this output stream by forcing any buffered output bytes that have already been processed by the encapsulated cipher object to be written out. <p> Any bytes buffered by the encapsulated cipher and waiting to be processed by it will not be written out. For example, if the encapsulated cipher is a block cipher, and the total number of bytes written using one of the <code>write</code> methods is less than the cipher's block size, no bytes will be written out.
