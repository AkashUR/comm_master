If this object has changed, as indicated by the <code>hasChanged</code> method, then notify all of its observers and then call the <code>clearChanged</code> method to indicate that this object has no longer changed. <p> Each observer has its <code>update</code> method called with two arguments: this observable object and <code>null</code>. In other words, this method is equivalent to: <blockquote><tt> notifyObservers(null)</tt></blockquote>
