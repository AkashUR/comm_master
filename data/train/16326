Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it is being reclaimed and that it should destroy any resources that it has allocated. The <code>stop</code> method will always be called before <code>destroy</code>. <p> A subclass of <code>Applet</code> should override this method if it has any operation that it wants to perform before it is destroyed. For example, an applet with threads would use the <code>init</code> method to create the threads and the <code>destroy</code> method to kill them. <p> The implementation of this method provided by the <code>Applet</code> class does nothing.
