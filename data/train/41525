If this method is called, the class file will be rebuilt when it is finally generated by <code>toBytecode()</code> and <code>writeFile()</code>. For a performance reason, the symbol table of the class file may contain unused entries, for example, after a method or a filed is deleted. This method removes those unused entries.  This removal will minimize the size of the class file.
