Immediately closes the socket connection if it's currently held by this engine. Use this to interrupt an in-flight request from any thread. It's the caller's responsibility to close the request body and response body streams; otherwise resources may be leaked. <p>This method is safe to be called concurrently, but provides limited guarantees. If a transport layer connection has been established (such as a HTTP/2 stream) that is terminated. Otherwise if a socket connection is being established, that is terminated.
