should return null if any of the following is true <ul> <li>v1 is null  <li>v2 is null <li>there is no edge connecting v1 to v2 in this graph </ul> otherwise should return _an_ edge connecting v1 to v2. May be directed or undirected (depending on the graph); may be any of the edges in the graph that so connect v1 and v2. Must _not_ return any directed edge for which v1 and v2 are distinct and v2 is the source.
