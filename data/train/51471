INTERNAL: This method is called only for canonical model generation during the  pre-processing stage. Canonical model generation needs to rebuild its  accessor list from one compile round to another within Eclipse. This  should not be called otherwise. Anything that is set in the addAccessor(MappingAccessor) method should  be cleared here.
