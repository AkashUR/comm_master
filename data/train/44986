Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during <code>installUI</code>.  This method is invoked when this <code>UIComponent</code> instance is being removed as the UI delegate for the specified component.  This method should undo the configuration performed in <code>installUI</code>, being careful to leave the <code>JComponent</code> instance in a clean state (no extraneous listeners, look-and-feel-specific property objects, etc.). This should include the following: <ol> <li>Remove any UI-set borders from the component. <li>Remove any UI-set layout managers on the component. <li>Remove any UI-added sub-components from the component. <li>Remove any UI-added event/property listeners from the component. <li>Remove any UI-installed keyboard UI from the component. <li>Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC. </ol>
