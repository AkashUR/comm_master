This method can be called to reverse updates on a all columns until all updates in a row have been rolled back to their originating state since the last synchronization (<code>acceptChanges</code>) or population. This method may also be called while performing updates to the insert row. <P> <code>undoUpdate</code may be called at any time during the life-time of a rowset, however after a synchronization has occurs this method has no affect until further modification to the RowSet data occurs.
