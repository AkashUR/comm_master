Called when the Load Credentials button is clicked. Attempts to read the user's saved Credentials from the Credentials API.  This may show UX, such as a credential picker or an account picker. <b>Note:</b> in a normal application loading credentials should happen without explicit user action, this is only connected to a 'Load Credentials' button for easier demonstration in this sample.  Make sure not to load credentials automatically if the user has clicked a "sign out" button in your application in order to avoid a sign-in loop. You can do this with the function <code>Auth.CredentialsApi.disableAuthSignIn(...)</code>.
