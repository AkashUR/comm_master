This method will test the <code>registerActionListeners</code> method. It will first create a simple tree consisting of a couple of <code>UICommand</code> components added to a facet;  Then the <code>ReconstituteComponentTree.execute</code> method is run;  And finally, an assertion is done to ensure that default action listeners have been registered on the <code>UICommand</code> components;
