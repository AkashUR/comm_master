DOM: The <code>stopPropagation</code> method is used prevent further propagation of an event during event flow. If this method is called by any <code>EventListener</code> the event will cease propagating through the tree.  The event will complete dispatch to all listeners on the current <code>EventTarget</code> before event flow stops.  This method may be used during any stage of event flow.
