When the receiver is activated then that means a message has been added to the message store, (either by the user or by the active services). The reason that the instanceof check is necessary is because there are two possible routes of activity: 1) The previous/current fragment viewed could have been the about fragment, if it was then the focused fragment is not a ListFragmentOrganizer and when the user returns to the feed then the feed will check its own data set and not crash. 2) The previous/current fragment is the feed, it needs to be notified immediately that there was a change in the underlying dataset.
