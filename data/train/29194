Refreshes the current row of this rowset's <code>ResultSet</code> object with its most recent value in the database.  This method cannot be called when the cursor is on the insert row. <P>The <code>refreshRow</code> method provides a way for an application to explicitly tell the JDBC driver to refetch a row(s) from the database.  An application may want to call <code>refreshRow</code> when caching or prefetching is being done by the JDBC driver to fetch the latest value of a row from the database.  The JDBC driver may actually refresh multiple rows at once if the fetch size is greater than one. <P> All values are refetched subject to the transaction isolation level and cursor sensitivity.  If <code>refreshRow</code> is called after calling an <code>updateXXX</code> method, but before calling the method <code>updateRow</code>, then the updates made to the row are lost.  Calling the method <code>refreshRow</code> frequently will likely slow performance.
