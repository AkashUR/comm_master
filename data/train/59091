Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state.  This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions (such as an  incoming phone call or SMS message) or when the user quits the application  and it begins the transition to the background state. Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and throttle down  OpenGL ES frame rates. Games should use this method to pause the game.
