This is based on a customer stress test that was able to reliably replicate the issue with the apache http components library. The test combines concurrent processes that <ul> <li>create a namespace</li> <li>load data into a namespace</li> <li>list the namespaces</li> <li>run SPARQL against a namespace</li> </ul> Note: This test is intended to run for an hour or more to identify a problem. It is run for a shorter period in CI.
