Records a class name that never exists. For example, a package name can be recorded by this method. This would improve execution performance since <code>get()</code> quickly throw an exception without searching the class path at all if the given name is an invalid name recorded by this method. Note that searching the class path takes relatively long time. <p>The current implementation of this method performs nothing.
