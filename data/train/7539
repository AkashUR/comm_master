Asks the disk store to start writing to a new oplog. The old oplog will be asynchronously compressed if compaction is set to true. The new oplog will be created in the next available directory with free space. If there is no directory with free space available and compaction is set to false, then a DiskAccessException saying that the disk is full will be thrown. If compaction is true then the application will wait for the other oplogs to be compacted and more space to be created
