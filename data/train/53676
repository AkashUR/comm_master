In many cases, it is desirable to immediately release a Statement's database and JDBC resources instead of waiting for this to happen when it is automatically closed. The close method provides this immediate release. <p> <B>Note:</B> A Statement is automatically closed when it is garbage collected. When a Statement is closed, its current ResultSet, if one exists, is also closed. </p>
