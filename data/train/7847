This method frees the <code>Array</code> object and releases the resources that  it holds. The object is invalid once the <code>free</code> method is called. <p> After <code>free</code> has been called, any attempt to invoke a method other than <code>free</code> will result in a <code>SQLException</code>  being thrown.  If <code>free</code> is called multiple times, the subsequent calls to <code>free</code> are treated as a no-op. <p>
