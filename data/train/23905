Close this SFTP session. NEVER forget to call this method to free up resources - even if you got an exception from one of the other methods. Sometimes these other methods may throw an exception, saying that the underlying channel is closed (this can happen, e.g., if the other server sent a close message.) However, as long as you have not called the <code>close()</code> method, you are likely wasting resources.
