Populates this <code>CachedRowSetImpl</code> object with data. This form of the method uses the rowset's user, password, and url or data source name properties to create a database connection.  If properties that are needed have not been set, this method will throw an exception. <P> Another form of this method uses an existing JDBC <code>Connection</code> object instead of creating a new one; therefore, it ignores the properties used for establishing a new connection. <P> The query specified by the command property is executed to create a <code>ResultSet</code> object from which to retrieve data. The current contents of the rowset are discarded, and the rowset's metadata is also (re)set.  If there are outstanding updates, they are also ignored. <P> The method <code>execute</code> closes any database connections that it creates.
