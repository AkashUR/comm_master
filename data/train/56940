Enables the recording of changes to this compilation unit and its descendents. The compilation unit must have been created by <code>ASTParser</code> and still be in its original state. Once recording is on, arbitrary changes to the subtree rooted at this compilation unit are recorded internally. Once the modification has been completed, call <code>rewrite</code> to get an object representing the corresponding edits to the original source code string.
