PUBLIC: If <em>all</em> the fields in the database row for the aggregate object are NULL, then, by default, the mapping will place a null in the appropriate source object (as opposed to an aggregate object filled with nulls). This behavior can be explicitly set by calling #allowNull(). To change this behavior, call #dontAllowNull(). Then the mapping will build a new instance of the aggregate object that is filled with nulls and place it in the source object. In either situation, when writing, the mapping will place a NULL in all the fields in the database row for the aggregate object. Note: Any aggregate that has a relationship mapping automatically does not allow null.
