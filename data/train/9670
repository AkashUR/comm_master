DOM: If an event is cancelable, the <code>preventDefault</code> method is used to signify that the event is to be canceled, meaning any default action normally taken by the implementation as a result of the event will not occur.  If, during any stage of event flow, the <code>preventDefault</code> method is called the event is canceled.  Any default action associated with the event will not occur.  Calling this method for a non-cancelable event has no effect.  Once <code>preventDefault</code> has been called it will remain in effect throughout the remainder of the event's propagation.  This method may be used during any stage of event flow.
