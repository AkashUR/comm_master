Called when the CQ is closed, the base region is destroyed, when the cache is closed, or when this listener is removed from a CqQuery using a <code>CqAttributesMutator</code>. <p> Implementations should cleanup any external resources such as database connections. Any runtime exceptions this method throws will be logged. <p> It is possible for this method to be called multiple times on a single callback instance, so implementations must be tolerant of this.
