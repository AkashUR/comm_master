Asif :Invoked after the intermediate resultset is iter evaluated to be used with the usable index of the operand for filter evaluatable Composite CompiledComparison for an AND type CompositeGroupJunction containing more than one filter evaluatable composite condition. This invocation implies that the indpendent group of iterators of one of the operands of the condition is also present in the intermediate resultset which means that index for that operand canot be used. Thus the intermediate Resultset is iterated & for each tuple , the values set in the respective RuntimeIterators. The operand without usable index is evaluated & the Index on the other operand is used to get resultset for that value. Thus for each tuple we query the index on other operand .
