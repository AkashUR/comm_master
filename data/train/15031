Makes this <code>Interpreter</code> entering in exiting mode. When in exiting mode, an interpreter waits for each session to finish its execution and then terminates gracefully the execution of the entire program. An interpreter in exiting mode cannot receive any more messages. Multiple calls of this method are redundant. The fact that the interpreter cannot receive any more messages after entering exiting mode can cause deadlocks if a session is waiting for a message to finish its execution. Use this method with caution.
